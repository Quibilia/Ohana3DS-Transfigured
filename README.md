# Ohana3DS Transfigured

ATTENTION: This project has not been touched by myself in any extensive way for an extremely long time. Most of the features and changes I implemented have since been reworked into Ohana3DS Rebirth, and as such I feel there is no need to continue the appearance of maintenance with Transfigured. I have since moved on to other projects and have no intention of returning to this one.

This program is my attempt to add features and correct some issues with Ohana3DS Rebirth to fit my own needs, published here on Github to better organize the code and share these new features with my peers.

Differences between Transfigured and Rebirth include:

The ability to read .pb and .pk animation files included in ROM dumps for Pokémon X and Y, and Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.

Corrections to the code which exports 3D models and animations to Autodesk COLLADA (.dae) files, which at this point is still not complete at Rebirth.

Batch processing, in the form of multiple-file drag-drop support. Because of technical issues, this is currently actually "drag-enter" processing: The program batch-reads and exports files as soon as they are dragged into the window, not when the mouse button is released.

Planned features include support for exporting animations other than skeletal movement, which are a bit difficult to encode in other formats. In addition, the very next feature on my list is support for Autodesk FBX files.

Ohana3DS Rebirth is a reboot of the program Ohana3DS, reconstructed in Visual C# based on the original, which was written in Visual Basic. This program uses large amounts of code drawn from Ohana3DS Rebirth, originally written by GDKChan of the VG Resource. This program is not meant to be individual: Periodically, this program will undergo "version shifts," a term I have given to the process of updating the original code based on Rebirth to the latest version published by GDKChan, which in most cases will likely mandate rewriting large segments of my modifications.

# Packaging textures with DAE models
The DAE container class allows the user to export models and textures together in one file, but only if they are organized in a certain directory structure:

(Root folder, i.e. Desktop)
- Models
- - BCH
- - - (.pc files here; rename them to .bch, because reasons)
- - DAE
- - - (leave empty)
- Textures
- - (texture folder name; MUST be identical to the corresponding .pc file)
- - - (.png files here)
- - (texture folder name)_Shiny
- - - (.png files here)
- - (texture folder name)_Xtra
- - - (bump map files here, in PNG format)

It's a little bit complicated, I know, and I apologize. But it's a bit difficult to implement a different way of doing it, and there isn't much need since the files are available in exactly this format from a certain popular source (check the VG Resource).

Drag-drop the BCH files into the Ohana3DS window. The Models/DAE folder will fill with DAE models set to use the corresponding textures, which will be copied to the DAE folder.
